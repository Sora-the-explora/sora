I'm a first year Computer Science PhD at the University of Maryland. I graduated in 2023 from Harvey Mudd College, where I worked with Lucas Bang on Metrinome and path complexity.

I'm passionate about [drum and bass](https://t.me/dnbhq), [board games](https://boardgamegeek.com/user/Soratheexplora), veganism, and trans issues 🏳️‍⚧️. Feel free to reach out and talk to me about any of these topics!
